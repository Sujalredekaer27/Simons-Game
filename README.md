# Simon Game 🎮


A classic memory-based game built with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. The game challenges players to remember and repeat an ever-increasing sequence of random colors.

## 🚀 How to Play
1. **Start:** Press any key on your keyboard to begin the game.
2. **Watch:** The game will flash a button (e.g., Pink, Green, Orange, or Purple).
3. **Repeat:** Click the buttons in the exact same order they were flashed.
4. **Level Up:** Every time you complete the sequence correctly, the game adds a new random color to the pattern and increases the level.
5. **Game Over:** If you click the wrong color, the screen will flash red, and you'll see your final score. Press any key to try again!

## 🛠️ Features
* **Dynamic Sequencing:** Uses JavaScript arrays to track and compare game vs. user patterns.
* **Visual Feedback:** Custom CSS classes for "flashing" effects when the game plays or the user clicks.
* **Score Tracking:** Real-time level updates in the header.
* **Responsive Logic:** Handles game resets and start states automatically.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for the game board.
* **CSS3:** Flexbox layout, rounded UI design, and transition animations.
* **JavaScript:** DOM manipulation, event listeners, and asynchronous timing (`setTimeout`).
